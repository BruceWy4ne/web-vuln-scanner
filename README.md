# Web Vulnerability Scanner

This is a command-line tool to scan websites using Nuclei, Wapiti, and Nikto, and intelligently combine their outputs into a single JSON report.

## Features

- Integrates three open-source scanners: Nuclei, Wapiti, and Nikto
- Merges scan results into a single structured report
- Multi-threaded scanning with Python multiprocessing
- Supports scanning a large list of websites
- Built and tested on Kali Linux

## Real-World Usage

- Scanned the top 10,000 Alexa-ranked Indian websites
- Successfully generated reports for approximately 7,785 responsive websites
- Sample scan data included in the `sample_data/` folder

## Requirements

The following tools must be pre-installed on your system:

- [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)
- [Wapiti](https://github.com/wapiti-scanner/wapiti)
- [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto)

Install required Python package:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

```bash
python scanner.py -w websites.txt -o output_dir -t 5
```

- `-w`: Path to a text file containing target websites (one per line)  
- `-o`: Directory to store output files  
- `-t`: Number of concurrent threads (default is 5)

## Output Format

Each website scan produces the following:

1. `nuclei_scan.json`  
2. `wapiti_scan.json`  
3. `nikto_scan.json`  
4. `combined.json` â€“ final merged report
